## James Fang: 
Third-year EECS undergrad with interests in AI, ML, and robotics. His contributions to the project included writing the pick-and-place (path planning + suction gripper) functions, intergrating the Tetris puzzle solver, and debugging issues with AR tracking.

## Miyuki Weldon: 
Third-year Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at UC Berkeley with interests in design, dynamics, and robotics. Her contributions to the project included designing and laser cutting the game pieces and adding the AR tags as well as helping with determining the AR tracking orientations.

## Jonathan Lee: 
Third-year EECS undergraduate at UC Berkeley with interests in robotics, artificial intelligence, and computer systems. His contributions to the project included integrating AR tracking, writing the project frontend UI, and refining the pick-and-place algorithm.
