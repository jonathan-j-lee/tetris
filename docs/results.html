      <h2>Performance</h2>
      <h3>Tile Detection</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned, tile recognition without AR tags was dropped from the final system after it became apparent the tile pose would be difficult to estimate.
        For example, consider the two images shown below.
        The one on the left is a raw camera image, and the one on the right is the same image after processing:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Convert the image to grayscale to reduce unnecessary computation.</li>
        <li>Convolve the image with a Gaussian kernel to smooth out high-frequency artifacts.</li>
        <li>Apply <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.sobel.html">Sobel</a> edge detection.</li>
        <li>Highlight points with high intensities in both the edge and grayscale images.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        While the processing did noticeably reduce glare from reflective surfaces like the table, other objects like the whiteboard and floor could still be confused for tiles.

* We are able to pick-and-place Square pieces reliably.
