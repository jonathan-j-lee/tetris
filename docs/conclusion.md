<!--(a) Discuss your results. How well did your finished solution meet your design criteria? 2 (b) Did you encounter any particular difficulties? (c) Does your solution have any flaws or hacks? What improvements would you make if you had additional time?-->
#Fulfillment of criteria
* 

#Challenges
* Identifying tiles without AR tags (glare, shape)
* Unstable AR marker estimates
* Unknown table height
* Tile types share an AR marker ID. 
* Bad grasps (depressions on tags).

#Hacks

#Improvements
* Robust AR tracking
* Adding 2 AR markers per tile for greater pose stability 
* Placing tags away from the tile center of mass
* Assigning unique AR tags
* Try to get it working without AR tags, that would fix a lot of issues, but perhaps introduce some new ones
